    <section>
        <p>Second-year computer science and software
        engineering student at Link√∂ping University.</p>

        <p>I am interested in summer internship opportunities
        in the software industry. I have knowledge of several
        programming languages such as Java and Python but with
        a special interest in C++. I have a passion for developing
        software, and I continuously try to learn more so that I can
        be as great as I possibly can be.</p>

        <p>In my free time I like learning more about software
        but I also have other hobbies such as reading where
        I primarily read science fiction.</p>

        <p>Some interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C++, Java and Python development</li>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
        </ul>
